# What is ProIcons
ProIcons is an open-source icon library of over 400+ icons, free for anyone to use in their project.

## Icons
The entire list of ProIcons is available [here](../../icons).

If you don't see an icon you wanted, you can always request an icon or add your own icon on [GitHub](https://github.com/ProCode-Software/proicons).

## Packages & Libraries
ProIcons is currently available for [HTML](../html-api), [Node.js/Vanilla JS](../javascript-api), [React](../react), and [Vue](../vue).

Packages for additional frameworks including Svelte and Roblox are planned. See the [roadmap](../roadmap) for more details.

## Tree-shaking
ProIcons libraries are compatible with ESM [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking). This allows you to bundle only the icons you need, rather than the entire set, when using a module bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). This becomes more important for performance as the icon set gets bigger.

## Roadmap
ProIcons is still a work in progress with new features and libraries coming soon. Learn more [here](./../roadmap).

## License
The ProIcons library is MIT-licensed, giving you the freedom to use, share, modify and distribute the library for personal and commercial use. Learn more [here](https://github.com/ProCode-Software/proicons/?tab=MIT-1-ov-file).
