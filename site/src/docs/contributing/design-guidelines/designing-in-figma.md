# Designing in Figma
We use Figma to design icons for the set, though you can also use other software. This is a guide on how to design your icons in Figma for the set.

## Step 1: Create a frame
Once you have a document opened, start by creating a 24px by 24px frame.
1. Press `F` or the <img src="/figma-design/frame.png" alt="frame" style="display: inline;"> icon to create a new frame.
2. Drag your cursor to draw a 24px by 24px frame. You can change the size later in the Properties panel on the right.

::: tip
Hold `Shift` to keep the width and height even while dragging.
