# Designing in Figma
We use Figma to design icons for the set, though you can also use other software. This is a guide on how to design your icons in Figma for the set.

## Step 1: Create a frame
Once you have a document opened, start by creating a 24px by 24px frame.
1. Press `F` or the <img src="/figma-design/frame.png" alt="frame" style="display: inline;"> icon to create a new frame.
2. Drag your cursor to draw a 24px by 24px frame. You can change the size later in the Properties panel on the right.

::: tip
Hold `Shift` to keep the width and height even while dragging.

3. Change the name of the frame to the name of your icon

## Step 2: Draw your shapes
Once you have your frame set up, start adding shapes to your icon. The most common shapes you will use would be:
* Rectangle (`R`)
* Elipse (`O`)
* Custom path using the Pen tool (`P`)

You can still use any shape.

### Stroke properties
1. In the Properties panel, press the <img src="/figma-design/plus.png" alt="âž•" style="display: inline;"> button beside **Stroke** to add a stroke if you haven't already.

2. Set the following properties for your shapes:
<img src="/figma-design/stroke-panel-1.png" width="350" alt="Stroke panel key">
    1. **Stroke color:** Set this to black (`#000`)
    2. **Stroke alignment:** This should always be centered
    3. **Stroke caps:** Set both of these to Round. Depending on your shape, this may not be shown.
    4. **Stroke width:** Set this to `1.5`
    5. Advanced stroke settings
3. Click on *Advanced stroke settings* as shown above, and set the following properties:
<img src="/figma-design/stroke-panel-2.png" width="350" alt="Advanced stroke settings key">
    1. **Stroke style:** Leave as Solid unless you are making a dotted shape
    2. **End point:** Set this to Round if you have this option
    3. **Join:** Set this to Round (third option)

::: tip
If you want these properties to automatically be applied to new shapes, go to *Figma logo > Edit > Set default properties* or `Ctrl + /`/`Command + /` > `Set default properties` after setting your properties on your shape. Note that this may not work for all shapes.

## Step 3: Export your icon
Once you have your icon designed, follow the steps in our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ProCode-Software/proicons/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-an-icon-1) on how to export your icon.
