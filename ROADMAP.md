A Community plugin that will allow you to add ProIcons into your design. It will also have the ability to automatically update ProIcons in your file.

## ProIcons for libraries
Packages for React, Vue, Svelte and Roblox are currently planned.

## Roblox Package
ProIcons are planned to be available on Roblox with the source code fully available here on GitHub, also written in TypeScript. Will also have APIs available similar to those in the JavaScript package.

## Roblox Plugin
A free and open-source plugin will be available to download for copying and adding icons into your game.

## Package and tree-shaking changes
We will be adding ESM tree-shaking for improved performance when using a bundler.
