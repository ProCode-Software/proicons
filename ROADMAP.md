# ProIcons Roadmap
This project is a work in progress and still has some things incomplete. Here are some things that are currently being planned for this project. Note that this list is subject to change and items can be added or removed.

## Icon Browser
An online browser to view all icons in the package. This will be available on https://procode-software.github.io/proicons/icons.

## Figma Plugin
A Community plugin that will allow you to add ProIcons into your design. It will also have the ability to automatically update ProIcons in your file.

## ProIcons for libraries
Packages for React, Vue and Roblox are currently planned.

## Roblox Package
ProIcons are planned to be available on Roblox with the source code fully available here on GitHub, also written in TypeScript. Will also have APIs available similar to those in the JavaScript package.

## Roblox Plugin
A free and open-source plugin will be available to download for copying and adding icons into your game.

## Package and tree-shaking changes
The package will be updated to combine `tags.json` and `icons.json` for easier icon addition and package efficiency. The API will also be optimised to tree-shaking for improved performance when using a bundler.

## Repository setup
We will also set up issue templates and contribution guides on this repository
