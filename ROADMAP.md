# ProIcons Roadmap
This project is a work in progress and still has some things incomplete. Here are some things that are currently being planned for this project. Note that this list is subject to change and items can be added or removed.

## Icon Browser
An online browser to view all icons in the package. This will be available on https://procode-software.github.io/proicons/icons.

## Figma Plugin
A Community plugin that will allow you to add ProIcons into your design. It will also have the ability to automatically update ProIcons in your file.

## ProIcons available as PNGs
ProIcons will also have high-quality PNGs available for download, and will all go through alpha blending so you won't have outlines around icons in some game engines.

This was delayed due to a vulnerability with the package I was using for this process.

## Roblox Package
ProIcons are planned to be available on Roblox with the source code fully available here on GitHub, also written in TypeScript. Will also have APIs available similar to those in the JavaScript package.

## Roblox Plugin
A free and open-source plugin will be available to download for copying and adding icons into your game.

## Package and API changes
The package will be updated to combine `tags.json` and `icons.json` for easier icon addition and package efficiency. The API will also allow you to import only the icons you need for performance and efficiency improvements when using module bundlers such as webpack.

## Repository setup
We will also set up issue templates and contribution guides on this repository
